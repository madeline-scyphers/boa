Section headers (ref) are created by underlining (and optionally overlining) the section title with a punctuation character, at least as long as the text:

=================
This is a heading
=================
Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s Style Guide for documenting which you may follow::


    # with overline, for parts
    * with overline, for chapters
    = for sections
    - for subsections
    ^ for subsubsections
    " for paragraphs
