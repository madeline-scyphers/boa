************************
Creating a model wrapper
************************

Using a model with boa requires writing a minimal wrapper to define the essential functions needed for boa to interact
with the model (i.e. reading and writing configurations for the model, running the model, and retrieving outputs from
the model).

.. note::
    A goal for the next stage of development is to allow for model wrapper functions to be written in other languages
    (e.g., R)

See the :ref:`instructions for creating a model wrapper <wrapper-user-guide>` for details.
