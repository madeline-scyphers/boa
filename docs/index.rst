Welcome to boa's documentation!
====================================

:doc:`BOA's </index>` is a high-level Bayesian optimization framework and model wrapping tool. It provides an easy-to-use interface
between models and the python libraries `Ax <https://ax.dev>`_ and `BoTorch <https://botorch.org>`_.

Key features
------------
- **Model agnostic**

    - Can be used for models in any language (not just python)
    - Can be used for Wrappers in any language (You don't even need to write any python!) See :mod:`Script Wrapper <.script_wrapper>` for details on how to do that.
    - Simple to implement for new models, with minimal coding required

- **Scalable**

  - Can be used for simple models or complex models that require a lot of computational resources
  - Scheduler to manage individual model runs
  - Supports parallelization

- **Modular & customizable**

  - Can take advantages of the many features of Ax/BoTorch
  - Customizable objective functions, multi-objective optimization, acquisition functions, etc
  - Choice of built-in evaluation metrics, but itâ€™s also easy to implement custom metrics
