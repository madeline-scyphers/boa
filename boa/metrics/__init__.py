Metrics are the objective functions we are optimizing over
or functions that we are adding in as further constraints of our problem.

Metrics can be specified in your configuration by detailing the name
of one of the predefined :mod:`Metrics <boa.metrics.metrics>` in BOA
by passing in the name of the metric into your configuration file

See :doc:`/user_guide/configuration`
